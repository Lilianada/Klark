## Adding New Dependencies
Before adding a new dependency, make sure it is essential to the project. You should open an issue to discuss the need for the dependency before submitting a pull request.

## Introducing New Features

We would üíñ you to contribute to Klark, but we also want to ensure Klark is loyal to its vision and mission statement üôè.

For us to find the right balance, please open an issue explaining your ideas before introducing a new pull request.

This will allow the Klark community to sufficiently discuss the new feature value and how it fits within the product roadmap and vision.

This is also important for the Klark lead developers to be able to provide technical input and potentially a different emphasis regarding the feature design and architecture. This will help to avoid wasting time and effort on a feature that might not align well with the product.

- Write blog posts or tutorials: Share your experience using Klark or write about a specific feature.
- Speak at meetups or conferences: Spread the word about Klark by giving talks or hosting workshops.
- Submit feedback or report bugs: Feedback is essential for improving Klark. Submit your ideas, experiences, or bugs through GitHub issues.
